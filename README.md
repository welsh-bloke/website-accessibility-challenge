# Web Page Accessibility: Code Refactor

## Description

This web page was created for the purpose of gaining experience in writing semantic, accessible HTML and CSS by improving the codebase of a starter project.

The starter project contained unsemantic HTML markup, functional errors and uncommented CSS. Left as it was, it would have caused problems for users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. It could also have caused issues regarding Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and litigation.

This web page was made accessible by ensuring:

- [The applications functions as intended]
- [The HTML markup follows semantic guidlines]
- [The Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.]
- [The Application's CSS file is properly commented]

## Deployment

The application wa deployed to GitHub Pages using the following process:

- [Pushing the refactored files to a remote repository]
- [From the repository, select the Settings tab on the right side of the page]
- [In the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source]
- [Click 'save']
- [The app is now available on GitHub Pages (see 'usage' below for access details)]
